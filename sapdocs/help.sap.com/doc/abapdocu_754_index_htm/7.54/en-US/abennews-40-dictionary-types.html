Data Types in ABAP Dictionary in Release 4.0 <br><br>
</span></p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENNEWS-40-DICTIONARY-TYPES_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
General
</span></p>
<p>
Until now data types were administered and defined in different ways in the ABAP programming language and in ABAP Dictionary.
</p>
<p>
In Release 3.0, many enhancements were made to the type concept in the ABAP programming language. Elementary
and structured data types can now be defined independently of each other. Structured data types can
be further subdivided into structures and internal tables. Structure components and row types in internal
tables can have any data type, which makes it possible to define extremely complex data types. If a complex data type is split into all its component parts, the result is always the elementary ABAP data types.
</p>
<p>
ABAP data types and ABAP Dictionary data types previously only genuinely corresponded to one another
if they were structures with elementary components. In ABAP Dictionary, the ABAP data type 'structure'
corresponded to the structure of database tables and standalone structures. From ABAP programs, the
addition <span class="qtext">LIKE</span> could be used to reference database tables and structures in
ABAP Dictionary. It was also possible to reference individual components of the dictionary types. Complex
ABAP data types, however, like internal tables or non-elementary structures had no direct equivalent
in the dictionary. From Release 3.0, type groups based on include technology were made available as an interim solution. These type groups allowed the user to store ABAP data types centrally in the dictionary.

Description of Functions
</span></p>
<p>
The following sections describe which dictionary data types correspond to individual ABAP data types and how they are addressed in ABAP:

<p><span class="h3">
Elementary Types
</span></p>
<p>
Elementary data types in ABAP correspond to the data elements that were until now only found in ABAP
Dictionary. From Release 4.5A, data elements will also be called elementary types in the dictionary.
For the time being, the two-tiered domain concept for elementary types retains its validity. The actual
elementary dictionary data type contains the semantic attributes, while the technical attributes are
defined in a domain. Elementary types and all previous dictionary data elements can be referenced directly
in ABAP programs using the addition <span class="qtext">TYPE</span>. This converts all external dictionary
data types into their corresponding ABAP data types. Elementary types are the smallest indivisible units
of those structured types and table types listed below. This means that all dictionary types contain semantic attributes such as texts, value tables, and documentation.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENNEWS-40-DICTIONARY-TYPES_4"></A>
<p><span class="h3">
Structured Types
</span></p>
<p>
Structures in ABAP correspond to the structures that up to now were only found in ABAP Dictionary. From
Release 4.5A, structures in the dictionary are called structured types. From Release 4.5A, individual
structured type components can have any dictionary data type, so making complex structures possible.
In ABAP programs, the addition <span class="qtext">TYPE</span> can be used to reference structured types
in ABAP programs. For reasons of compatibility, the <span class="qtext">LIKE</span> reference to structured types is retained.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENNEWS-40-DICTIONARY-TYPES_5"></A>
<p><span class="h3">
Table Types
</span></p>
<p>
From Release 4.5A, table types can be defined in ABAP Dictionary. These table types have exactly the
same specification as internal tables in ABAP, including an access type, key, and row type. Any dictionary
data type can be used as a row type, so making complex nested tables possible. In ABAP programs, the addition <span class="qtext">TYPE</span> can be used to reference table types in the dictionary.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENNEWS-40-DICTIONARY-TYPES_6"></A>
<p><span class="h3">
Database Tables
</span></p>
<p>
As well as the central administration of data types, the most important task of ABAP Dictionary is still
the administration of database tables. The dictionary describes the elementary types from which the
structured type of a data record in the database table is constructed. As in the past, it is still possible
to use the addition <span class="qtext">LIKE</span> in ABAP to reference the structure of database tables
and of individual data fields. From 4.5A, it is also possible to use <span class="qtext">TYPE</span> to reference the structure and fields of database tables.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENNEWS-40-DICTIONARY-TYPES_7"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Outlook
</span></p>
<p>
SAP plans to enable the central definition of constants in ABAP Dictionary. This is currently only possible
in type groups. Also, a comprehensive bundling concept will make the encapsulation done in type groups available throughout the system.
