Logical Databases - Selection Views
</span></p>
<p>
Selection views are collections of fields from different database tables. At runtime, additional selections for the fields of these selection views can be defined using
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenldb_free_selections.html')" class="blue">dynamic selections</a>. These additional selections
are passed to the database and reduce the number of database reads. Before this can happen, the database
tables must be defined for dynamic selections in the selection include of the logical database and the database program must be programmed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Selection views can be edited by choosing <span class="italic">Extras &rarr; Selection Views</span> in
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenlogical_database_build_glosry.html')" class="grey" title="Glossary Entry">Logical Database
Builder</a>. They are identified by a three-character key that describes the origin of the selection
view: <span class="qtext400">SAP</span> for predefined selections views or <span class="qtext400">CUS</span>
for customer-defined selection views. In this way, users can define the selection view that best meets their requirements for a given logical database.
</p>
<p>
If a selection view is to be used in a logical database, the only permitted name is <span class="qtext400">STANDARD</span>
and it must be associated with a logical database. In selection views not associated with a special logical database, any name can be chosen.
</p>
<p>
The following rules apply when constructing dynamic selections on selections screens of logical databases:
Only those selection views are used that have the name <span class="qtext400">STANDARD</span> and that
are associated with the logical database. If a customer-defined selection view (with key <span class="qtext400">CUS</span>)
exists, this view is used; if not, the predefined selection view is used. If there is no selection view
with the name <span class="qtext400">STANDARD</span> associated with the logical database, dynamic selections are constructed across all fields of all tables in the logical database.
</p>
<p>
Selection views have the following elements:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Function groups</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>
In selection views, fields are collected in functional groups. All fields assigned to a functional group
can be found in the view. The grouping of fields in functional groups facilitates the combination of
fields by content and makes them easier to find later. Functional groups are defined by assigning a
functional group ID and a text. The functional group ID can consist of any two characters and is important only when the selection view is being edited.
</dd></dl>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Tables/nodes</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>
The names of the database tables from which fields can be selected for the selection view. The fields
of each of these tables can be displayed in the lower part of the screen. The table can be selected by choosing Select or by double-clicking the table name or node name.
</dd></dl>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Fields of the table/node</li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>
Here, a field is assigned to a functional group and becomes part of the selection view. Before a field
assigned to a function group can be used as a dynamic selection in the logical database, the corresponding
node in the database program of the logical database must also be defined accordingly. A field assigned
to a functional group can be flagged for a preselection. The fields flagged in this way appear as selection
criteria on the selection screen of the dynamic selections. The preselected fields can be modified by
choosing <span class="italic">New Field Selection</span> on this selection screen. A selection list
appears of all fields in the selection view and for which dynamic selections are supported in the corresponding nodes of the logical database.
