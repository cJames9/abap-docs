Selecting the Numeric Type
</span></p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENSELECT_NUMERIC_TYPE_GUIDL_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Background
</span></p>
<p>
Multiple numeric types with various properties and value ranges are available in ABAP, which can be used for storing numbers and for calculations:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Signed 4-byte integer numbers (type <span class="qtext">i</span>) and 8-byte integer numbers (type
<span class="qtext">int8</span>) (1-byte and 2-byte-integers with the internal types <span class="qtext">b</span>
and <span class="qtext">s</span> are also available.) However, these data objects cannot be created based on a built-in ABAP type. Instead, the built-in ABAP Dictionary types INT1 and INT2 are required.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Packed numbers in BCD format (binary coded decimals, type <span class="qtext">p</span>)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Binary floating point numbers (type <span class="qtext">f</span>)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Decimal floating point numbers (types <span class="qtext">decfloat16</span>, <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The decimal floating point numbers meet the requirements for highly exact processing of decimal numbers
in a large value ranges, where the data types <span class="qtext">p</span> and <span class="qtext">f</span> only cover a single aspect each.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENSELECT_NUMERIC_TYPE_GUIDL_2"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Rule
</span></p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Choose suitable numeric types for numbers and calculations</span>
</p>
<p>
Choose a numeric type to suit the values to be represented to achieve the highest possible speed and accuracy. Here is a general rule of thumb:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="qtext">i</span> and <span class="qtext">int8</span> for integers</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="qtext">p</span> for fixed point numbers</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="qtext">decfloat16</span> or <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span> for floating point numbers</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="qtext">f</span> in exceptional cases only</li>
</ul>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENSELECT_NUMERIC_TYPE_GUIDL_3"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Details
</span></p>
<p>
The calculation speed and accuracy are generally contradictory requirements and depend on the data type
of the objects to be processed. Therefore, when choosing the numeric type, both these two requirements must be weighed up. These considerations must also include the value range to be represented:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If the values to be mapped are integers, type <span class="qtext">i</span> or <span class="qtext">int8</span>
must usually be used. This guarantees the highest possible calculation speed. Examples of these integers
include counters, indexes, offsets and time intervals. If the values to be mapped exceed the value range
of type <span class="qtext">int8</span> or <span class="qtext">i</span>, you can use type <span class="qtext">p</span>
without decimal places instead. The calculation speed is slower, but decimal places are still represented accurately (except for rounding errors). If this value range is still not sufficient, a floating point type
(<span class="qtext">decfloat16</span> and <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span>) can be used instead.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>If non-integer values that have a fixed number of decimal places are to be represented, the type
<span class="qtext">p</span> can be used. However, calculations with type <span class="qtext">p</span>
are executed in the ABAP kernel and not by the hardware. Examples of non-integer values include lengths, weights, or monetary amounts. If this value range is still not sufficient, a decimal floating point type
(<span class="qtext">decfloat16</span> and <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span>) can be used instead.
The binary floating point type <span class="qtext">f</span> is less suitable because it cannot represent
all decimal fractions. This is a further impediment for calculation accuracy (in addition to the unavoidable rounding errors).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>For non-integer values with a variable number of decimal places or a large value range, the decimal
floating point types <span class="qtext">decfloat16</span> or <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span>
should be used. Decfloat34 has a greater number of places and a greater value range. However, this also leads to increased memory consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks to the hardware support available on all platforms, binary floating point type <span class="qtext">f</span>
allows fast calculations. However, it is inferior to the new decimal floating point types due to the following reasons:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Type <span class="qtext">f</span> can only accurately represent fractions with the power of two
in the denominator (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.) and totals. Other values are rounded according to this representation.
This rounding process does not correspond to the decimal rounding process (and  usually does not meet
the expectations of the developer or user). For example, the value 0.815 is approximated internally
as 8.1499999999999995E-01. This means when the value is rounded to two decimal places, 0.81 is returned instead of the expected value 0.82.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Very large numbers can no longer be represented exactly (working in line with IEEE 754) if the difference
between the largest and smallest exponent is greater than 52 (in the total of powers of two). For example, 1E+23 is represented as 9.9999999999999992E+22.s</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>A number of type <span class="qtext">f</span> cannot be rounded to a specific number of decimal places, if the result needs to be assigned to another number of type <span class="qtext">f</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Divisions by powers of 10, which often occur when converting metric units, for example, are not exact. 8.0500000000000005E-01 is returned for 805/1000, for example.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Simple calculations often produce unexpected results. 123456.15 - 123455 returns 1,1499999999941792, for example.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The conversion of binary floating point numbers to other number formats is not clearly defined in
line with IEEE 754. Consequently, when data is stored in the database, the rounding behavior depends on the platform and how numbers of type <span class="qtext">f</span> are represented in the database.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The decimal floating point types <span class="qtext">decfloat16</span> and <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span>
do not have these problems. Both have a greater value range than type <span class="qtext">f</span>,
and <span class="qtext">decfloat34</span> has 34 places instead of 16 places. However, the following restrictions apply:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="circlem2">
<li>Currently, calculations with decimal floating point types are generally even slower than calculations
with the type <span class="qtext">f</span> (the speed is comparable to calculations with the type <span class="qtext">
p</span>). Until now, only IBM's Power6 architecture provided hardware support for floating point calculations
of this type in accordance with IEEE-754-2008. On other platforms, calculations with decimal floating
point numbers have to be performed on the software side in the ABAP kernel, in a similar way to calculations with the type <span class="qtext">p</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="circlem2">
<li>Decimal floating point types are not yet supported by associated data types on all database platforms.
As an interim solution, ABAP Dictionary provides a set of built-in data types DF16_..., DF34_..., based
on existing types (DEC and RAW). In most cases, the benefits of the decimal floating point types compensate
for the current slow calculation speed. However, it might still be necessary to use type <span class="qtext">f</span>
if there are stringent requirements for performance and less stringent requirements for calculation
accuracy. Remember that the speed advantage currently possible for calculations with <span class="qtext">f</span>,
may be outweighed by the fact that conversions from <span class="qtext">f</span> to other numeric types are relatively slow.</li>
</ul>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENSELECT_NUMERIC_TYPE_GUIDL_4"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Note
</span></p>
<p>
For programs that are currently created with decimal floating point types, the performance is increased
as soon as the processor architecture supports decimal floating point calculations and the ABAP runtime
environment starts using this hardware support. Calculations with decimal floating point numbers then become faster than calculations with packed numbers.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Bad Example
</span></p>
<p>
The following source code shows a declaration of a binary floating point number. The start value 0.815 is assigned. The true start value, however, is 8.1499999999999995E-01.
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">DATA number TYPE f VALUE '0.815'.</span>
</dd></dl>
<p><span class="h4">
Good Example
</span></p>
<p>
The following source code shows a declaration of a decimal floating point number. The start value 0.815 is assigned. The true start value is actually 8.15E-01.
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">DATA number TYPE decfloat34 VALUE '0.815'</span>
</dd></dl>
