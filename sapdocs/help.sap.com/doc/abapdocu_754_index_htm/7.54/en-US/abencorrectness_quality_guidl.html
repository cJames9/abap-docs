Correctness and Quality
</span></p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENCORRECTNESS_QUALITY_GUIDL_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Background
</span></p>
<p>
Most organizations that develop professional software have product standards that must be adhered to.
These product standards define what is meant by correctness and quality of a program. SAP has many such
standards, which development departments have to comply with. The current product standards that are most important to developers are listed below:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Accessibility</span> <br>In the information technology environment, the term
accessibility relates to the requirement that anyone, including and especially those with impairments,
can access and use information technology products. To make products such as software or websites accessible
to all consumers, they must be created and designed so that they can still be used if users have a particular
impairment (for example, visual impairment, color blindness) and must be compatible with technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Documentation</span> <br>As a rule, a product standard for documentation defines
which documents have to be shipped to the consumer with the product and ensures that the documentation supplied is consistent, correct, and up to date across all product areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Functional Correctness</span> <br>The functional correctness of software is generally
seen as its most important quality. Software that is not functionally correct is usually unusable. As
a rule, a product standard for functional correctness requires software to be error-free, and defines
the stability of interfaces and program behavior during upgrades. To reach these goals, thorough testing of the software may be made compulsory.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Globalization</span> <br>If software is to be used worldwide, a product standard for globalization is usually necessary. This covers the aspects of internationalization and localization.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="circlem2">
<li><span class="bold">Internationalization</span> <br>Internationalization comprises the technical
aspects of globalization such as Unicode compatibility, text processing, screen display, printing, data
exchange, time zones, translatability, and so on, and thus sets out the technical prerequisites for
localization. The translation of user interfaces and other texts is also, of course, an important aspect of internationalization.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="circlem2">
<li><span class="bold">Localization</span> <br>Localization is necessary if software for global use
has to be adapted to local (usually country-specific) conditions, such as legal requirements or particular business procedures.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Performance</span> <br>Even if a program is functionally correct, it is of little
or no use to a user if it cannot be executed in a reasonable time. A performance product standard ensures
that this aspect is not neglected. It can include, for example, rules for efficient database access and scalability of application logic.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Security</span> <br>Where security is critical to software, and this is generally
the case for any type of business software, a product standard for security sets out all security-relevant
aspects of a product, by pointing out any potential security gaps or legal requirements, for example, and also contains instructions for meeting the standard.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span class="bold">Usability</span> <br>The term usability refers to the adaptation of user interfaces
to the requirements of human end users and their tasks. A usability product standard should ensure that
end users can perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. Key aspects of usability include consistency
of user interfaces, ease of use, intuitive task-friendly and role-friendly interfaces, individual adaptability, error tolerance, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although these standards are, in part, legal requirements, they essentially arise from the fundamental
aim to guarantee the correctness and quality of the software that is shipped to consumers. Programming
guidelines are very important in this respect. Many of the guidelines listed here support, directly
or indirectly, one of the standards mentioned or are derived from them. They support and ensure compliance
with such standards, resulting in correct, high-quality programs. The programming guidelines themselves could even be said to be on a par with binding product standards.
</p>
<p>
However, since not all possible product standards can be covered by the programming guidelines, for example all rules of a performance or security standard, we set out the following basic rule.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENCORRECTNESS_QUALITY_GUIDL_2"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Rule
</span></p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Comply with or check compliance with existing product standards</span>
</p>
<p>
Adhere to the product standards that exist in your organization, and ensure the correctness and quality of your programs by testing them during development and after completion with all the test tools at your disposal.
</p>

<p><span class="h2">
Details
</span></p>
<p>
It is obvious that you must comply with product standards; this needs no further explanation. However,
it is often forgotten that the static and dynamic analysis tools that are available in the ABAP environment
can provide invaluable help for compliance with important product standards, particularly standards
for functional correctness and performance. Therefore, as part of this basic rule we recommend that you use all available tools that help to ensure the correctness and quality of ABAP programs.
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Perform the <a href="javascript:call_link('abenextended_program_check_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">extended
program check</a> (transaction <span class="lnkgrey">SLIN</span>) on a regular basis and correct all messages.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Use the <a href="javascript:call_link('abencode_inspector_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">Code Inspector</a>
tool (transaction <span class="lnkgrey">SCI</span>) on a regular basis using the standard check variant, and correct all messages.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Check the usability and accessibility of your interface elements by using the appropriate tools (integrated into the workbench tools and
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenabap-testcockpit_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">ABAP Test Cockpit</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Cover all functions of your procedural units by using units tests with ABAP Unit (integrated into ABAP Workbench, Code Inspector, and ABAP Test Cockpit).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Cover all functions of your applications by using scenario tests with eCATT (transaction <span class="lnkgrey">SECATT</span>).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Check the memory consumption of your programs by using ABAP Memory Inspector (transaction <span class="lnkgrey">S_MEMORY_INSPECTOR</span> and the memory analysis function integrated into ABAP Debugger).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Check the runtime behavior and the performance. In SAP GUI use the ABAP runtime analysis (transaction <span class="lnkgrey">SAT</span>) and in the
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenadt_glosry.html')" class="grey" title="Glossary Entry">ABAP Development Tools (ADT)</a> use the ABAP Profiler.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Check the test coverage by using Coverage Analyzer (transaction <span class="lnkgrey">SCOV</span> and integrated into ABAP Unit Browser of ABAP Workbench).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Follow the <a href="javascript:call_link('abenabap_security.html')" class="blue">ABAP - Security Notes</a> to protect your programs and data from attacks from outside.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Document your programs and services using all available means: Starting with
<a href="javascript:call_link('abencomments_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">comments</a>, this ranges from
simple data element documentation for context-sensitive input help, to class and method documentation
for documenting APIs, to explanations of concepts and tutorials in other repositories such as SAP Knowledge Warehouse, or on the Internet, for example in the SAP Developer Community (SCN, http://scn.sap.com).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="javascript:call_link('abencts_glosry.html')" class="grey" title="Glossary Entry">ABAP Test Cockpit</a> (ATC) integrated into ABAP Workbench and the
<a href="javascript:call_link('abencts_glosry.html')" class="grey" title="Glossary Entry">Change and Transport System (CTS)</a>
supports the execution and evaluation of the most important tests. Some of these tests also check compliance with some of the rules of the ABAP programming guidelines discussed later.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Note
</span></p>
<p>
Where in doubt, product standards take precedence over the guidelines and recommendations of this documentation.
If, for example, performance or security aspects prohibit any of the programming practices presented here, compliance with the standard takes priority.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Good Example
</span></p>
<p>
Executing unit tests for classes of the package <span class="lnkgrey">SABAP_DEMOS_CAR_RENTAL_APPL</span>
and displaying the results in ABAP Unit Browser of Object Navigator gives a test coverage of 100%. This
package is shipped as a subpackage for the application part of a small example application, which, in addition to unit tests, also demonstrates strict adherence to the
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenseperation_concerns_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">separation of concerns</a>.
