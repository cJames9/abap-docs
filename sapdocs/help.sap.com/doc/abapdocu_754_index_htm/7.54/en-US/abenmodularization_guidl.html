Modularization
</span></p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENMODULARIZATION_GUIDL_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Background
</span></p>
<p>
The main programming model that was propagated before the implementation of ABAP Objects was <span class="italic">structured programming</span>:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>In this model, the programs are split into procedures as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Sequences, branches, and loops are the only control structures permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The implementation of object-oriented programming languages such as ABAP Objects does not make structured
programming obsolete. Object-oriented programming is based on the structured programming and enhances and supplements it.
</p>
<p>
With regard to ABAP, you must note that ABAP is still a programming language of the fourth generation
(4GL) that has been developed especially for application programming in the SAP environment, that is,
for mass data processing in business applications. Therefore, ABAP includes significantly more language
elements than an elementary programming language in which the more complex functions are usually stored
in libraries. This ranges from simple statements for string processing, which are provided as methods
of string classes in other object-oriented languages such as Java, to the processing of complex mass
data objects, such as internal tables, to very complex statements for operating interfaces such as ABAP SQL or for calling data transformations (XML), for which other languages have entire class hierarchies.
</p>
<p>
As already <a href="javascript:call_link('abenobj_oriented_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">mentioned</a>, the
performance of the ABAP language is therefore optimized mainly for the execution of its complex statements for mass data processing and less for the individual method call.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENMODULARIZATION_GUIDL_2"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Rule
</span></p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Modularize rather than atomize</span>
</p>
<p>
Modularize your program in classes, but not to the extent that there is an individual method for every
trivial function. Methods that consist of only one or just a few statements should be an exception in ABAP and not the rule.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENMODULARIZATION_GUIDL_3"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Details
</span></p>
<p>
You should only use <a href="javascript:call_link('abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">methods
of ABAP Objects</a> for the implementation of functions; there are very good reasons for this. But ABAP
remains ABAP, and the good reasons for using a well-structured program are not invalidated by the implementation
of ABAP Objects. Indeed, the ABAP language elements proven and tested in so many application cases are
still valid today, are undergoing continuously development, and should be used in their present form in ABAP Objects as well.
</p>
<p>
A well-structured classic ABAP program, for instance a function group that fulfills a specific task
and is modularized using subroutines, should therefore be transferable to a class without any major changes to the implementation, while being provided with all the additional benefits of ABAP Objects.
</p>
<p>
However, the modularization at the level of a few single statements is and will remain untypical for
ABAP. On the one hand this is because of performance reasons, because the costs for the method call
must remain low in comparison to the costs for executing the implementation. For example, instead of
providing the <span class="qtext">get_attribute</span> methods typical for other object-oriented languages
that only set their return value to the value of an attribute <span class="qtext">attribute</span>,
you should use public <span class="qtext">READ-ONLY</span> attributes in ABAP. (If reads on an attribute
are associated with further actions, for example, authorization checks, <span class="qtext">get_attribute</span>
methods are appropriate of course.) On the other hand, virtually all non-fundamental statements of ABAP
(all language elements that do not have any equivalent in an elementary language like Java) already
play the same role that the methods of system classes assume in other programming languages. The use of a statement like this corresponds to a method call, and another encapsulation is usually not necessary.
</p>
<p>
Also, for legibility and maintainability reasons, a method with a
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenproc_volume_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">reasonable size</a> is preferable to splitting into atomic units, that is, into methods with only one or two statements.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Exception
</span></p>
<p>
Procedures that encapsulate nothing but the call of another procedure are an exception. A single procedure
call represents the implementation of an entire procedure. This applies in particular to function modules and subroutines, which can only be created in
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenabap_obj_progr_model_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">exceptional cases</a> anyway. They should include exactly one
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenfunct_module_subroutine_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">method call</a>,
which delegates the implementation to ABAP Objects. In this case, the improved security through the stricter checks in ABAP Objects outweighs the disadvantages of very short procedures.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Bad Example
</span></p>
<p>
The following source code shows the rudimentary implementation of a string class in ABAP Objects. The
methods of this class each contain only a single statement. A consumer must create objects of the class and call the methods to handle the strings.
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">CLASS cl_string DEFINITION PUBLIC. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC SECTION. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; METHODS: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constructor IMPORTING value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TYPE string OPTIONAL, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set_string&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPORTING value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TYPE string, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get_string&nbsp;&nbsp;RETURNING VALUE(value) TYPE string, <br>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shift_left&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPORTING places&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TYPE i, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shift_right IMPORTING places&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TYPE i, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIVATE SECTION. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DATA string TYPE string. <br>ENDCLASS.</span>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">CLASS cl_string IMPLEMENTATION. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD constructor. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string = value. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD set_string. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string = value. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD get_string. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value = string. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD shift_left. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHIFT string LEFT BY places PLACES. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD shift_right. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHIFT string RIGHT BY places PLACES. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>ENDCLASS. <br>...</span>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">CLASS application IMPLEMENTATION. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD do_something. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DATA string TYPE REF TO cl_string. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CREATE OBJECT string EXPORTING value = 'abcde'. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string->shift_left( ... ). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br>ENDCLASS.</span>
</dd></dl>
<p><span class="h4">
Good Example
</span></p>
<p>
The following source code shows the handling of strings typical to ABAP. A method directly declares
a data object of type <span class="qtext">string</span> and directly uses the corresponding ABAP statements for processing.
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">CLASS application IMPLEMENTATION. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; METHOD do_something. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DATA string TYPE string. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHIFT string LEFT BY ... PLACES. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDMETHOD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;... <br>ENDCLASS.</span>
</dd></dl>
<p>
There is a corresponding built-in function for almost every string processing statement. They can also
be used in operand positions, negating another reason for the encapsulation of statements in methods.
The statement <span class="qtext">SHIFT LEFT</span> in this example can be replaced as follows, whereas <span class="qtext">shift_left</span> is a built-in function:
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">string = shift_left( val = string places = ... ).</span>
</dd></dl>
