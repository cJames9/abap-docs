Memory Consumption of Dynamic Memory Objects
</span></p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENMEM_CONS_DYN_MEM_OBJ_GUIDL_1"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Background
</span></p>
<p>
In dynamic objects, the actual data is addressed using a reference. This means that dynamic memory objects are always deep objects. Possible dynamic memory objects are:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Table bodies of internal tables addressed using internal table references</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Text strings or byte strings addressed using internal string references</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Anonymous data objects created using <span class="qtext">CREATE DATA</span> and addressed using data references in data reference variables</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Instances of classes created using <span class="qtext">CREATE OBJECT</span> and addressed using object references in object reference variables</li>
</ul>
<p>
The maximum total size and number of all dynamically managed memory objects in an
<a href="javascript:call_link('abeninternal_session_glosry.html')" class="grey" title="Glossary Entry">internal session</a> are defined in principle by the maximum amount of memory that this session can request to execute programs.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the available memory on the current AS Instance, there are two further technical limits that can restrict the size of individual dynamic memory objects:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The upper limit is 2&#x00B3;&#x00B9;-1 for the size of a string in bytes (in the character representation
<a href="javascript:call_link('abenucs2_glosry.html')" class="grey" title="Glossary Entry">UCS-2</a> used by the ABAP programming language, every character in a string occupies 2 bytes) and the number of rows in an internal table.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The memory for the content of a string and for hash management of an internal hashed table must
be provided as one piece. Therefore, the <span class="qtext">ztta/max_ memreq_mb</span> profile parameter
is relevant for these two memory object types. It defines the maximum amount of memory that can be requested
as one piece. A maximum size for strings and a limitation on the number of rows in hashed tables can
be directly derived from this amount. This limitation does not depend on the width of table rows. Only
the hash management (and not the table content) must be provided as one piece in the memory. The current
limitation is the highest power of two, which is less than or equal to an eighth of the value specified
by the profile parameter. For example, if the profile parameter specifies 250MB, a hashed table can contain approximately 16 million rows.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any attempt to exceed these limits produces a runtime error and the termination of the program.

Rule
</span></p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Avoid memory bottlenecks</span>
</p>
<p>
When using dynamic memory objects, ensure that the program is not terminated due to a lack of memory.
</p>
<A name="@@ITOC@@ABENMEM_CONS_DYN_MEM_OBJ_GUIDL_3"></A>
<p><span class="h2">
Details
</span></p>
<p>
Memory limits are fixed limitations that cannot be deactivated with programming. To avoid memory bottlenecks, we recommend that you account for:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The limits of the available physical memory when developing a program</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The specified technical limits for strings and hashed tables</li>
</ul>
<p>
The only way to prevent memory limits from being exceeded is to use programming to restrict the data
loaded into the memory. This applies to processing large data sets and also to object creation. The
latter can produce memory bottlenecks if overly large objects or too many small objects are created. <span class="italic">Memory leaks</span> (unused, unreleased memory) can also cause memory problems.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Editing Large Data Sets</span> <br>You need to process large data sets that are stored
in a persistent repository as one piece, but the sets do not fit into the available memory. In this
case, you must import and process these data sets, either in packages or sequentially. A common language
element here is the <span class="qtext">PACKAGE SIZE</span> addition. You can this addition when importing
large data sets to internal tables with the ABAP SQL statement <span class="qtext">SELECT</span>. Memory-saving
processing of large strings (Large Object, LOB) in database tables is also possible. Locators enable
you to access substrings of strings in database tables. Streaming allows a sequential and gradual transfer of data into the memory. Both concepts were predominantly introduced in ABAP to avoid memory bottlenecks.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Releasing Memory</span> <br>The main advantage of dynamically managed memory is that
it can be released again. Use this option to delete data and objects no longer required, to avoid memory leaks and possible memory bottlenecks:
</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>You can delete strings using the <span class="qtext">CLEAR</span> statement.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>You can use <span class="qtext">CLEAR</span> or <span class="qtext">FREE</span> to delete internal
tables. <span class="qtext">FREE</span> releases the entire memory space occupied by rows, whereas the initial memory requirement of the table remains reserved if <span class="qtext">CLEAR</span> is used. An appropriate size for the
<a href="javascript:call_link('abeninitial_memory_requ_guidl.html')" class="lnkpurple" title="Guideline">initial memory requirement</a>
is usually defined by the ABAP runtime environment itself. However, it can also be predefined using the <span class="qtext">INITIAL SIZE</span> addition.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Anonymous data objects and instances of classes are deleted by the Garbage Collector, after <span class="italic">
all</span> reference variables that refer to these objects have been initialized. Here, you must ensure
that all references are actually identified during initialization. This is not always straightforward,
particularly in the case of complex object networks. To analyze memory problems and detect memory leaks,
you can use Memory Inspector and the ABAP Debugger memory analysis. You can display memory consumption rankings for all dynamically managed memory objects.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="h4">
Note
</span></p>
<p>
Note that statically managed data objects can also involve unnecessary memory consumption. For example,
large flat structures with unused or initial components, whose initial values require a lot of memory
space. Here, strings that only contain blanks occupy 2 bytes for each blank. The situation can become
particularly critical if these structures are combined with dynamic techniques (if they are used as
internal table rows, for example). Consequently, boxed components were introduced. They support initial
value sharing for initial substructures, which means that the initial value of a substructure is created
only once in memory. For structures with substructures that have a sparse fill level, this can reduce memory consumption and copy costs significantly.
</p>
<p><span class="h4">
Bad Example
</span></p>
<p>
In the following source code, all the data in a very large database table is imported into an internal table. Here there is an obvious risk of memory bottlenecks.
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">SELECT * <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM very_large_table <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTO TABLE ...</span>
</dd></dl>
<p><span class="h4">
Good Example
</span></p>
<p>
In the following source code, the <span class="qtext">PACKAGE SIZE</span> addition is used. This restricts the maximum size of the internal table to a secure level.
</p>
<dl><dd>
<span class="qtext">SELECT * <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM very_large_table <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTO TABLE ... PACKAGE SIZE 1000. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDSELECT.</span>
</dd></dl>
